** Tutorial
When starting out for the first time the player is instructed through
a tutorial. He/She/Them learns the basics of the game. Afterwards the
player should choose their main guild which will lead them to /spawn/ on
the suitable HQ. From there on the adventure begins!
** Spawn
The spawn hub where players start out the game. C4MPU5 K441.
** Choosing a guild                                                    :WIP:
The player chooses a main guild from four choices.
1) Guild
2) Guild
3) Guild
4) Guild

- Martian ::
  - Longer cooldowns on travel commands.
  - More energy in battleships.

- Dwarf ::
  - Can mine faster.
  - Can sell resources at higher price

* Main Guild                                                            :MVP:
** Guild Communication                                                 :WIP:
Upon the creation of guilds, channels are created for dedicated use.
The purpose is to make it easy for guild players to interact with
their fellow guild members.

*** Global channels
These are accessible to the entire server.
+ text:
  - #general :: For talking about game stuff with everyone. 
  - questions :: Here people can ask questions to the main community
  - #announcements :: Players cannot post here. This is for global
    game announcements by the server itself.

+ voice:
  - general :: General voice for server-wide stuff.

*** Channels per guilds
These created channels will only be accessible from people inside of
the guild.  A main guild gets the current default channels:

+ text:
  - #general :: To communicate about game related stuff.
  - #announcements :: The guild leader has the permission to ping
    people here and can send messages to all people, this channel
    will also be used for related ~guild activities~. This channel will
    be in slow mode.
  - #off-topic :: People can talk about things that do not fit in =#general=.
  - #trading :: channel where users can con themselves
  - guides :: Through the guides ~forum~, players can share their
    knowledge, strategies and findings.
*Text channels in the main guild have ~slow mode~ enabled by default

  - quarters :: for general vocal stuff
  - meeting room :: a stage channel, officers can host stages to talk
    to the guild members
** Hierarchy
A guild is composed of a guild leader and optionally
officers. Officers and the leader can iniate building creations. 
*** Becoming officer
To become an officer in main guilds you need to reach a certain
~reputation~ threshold.
** Guild HQ
A guild has head quarters on a mother planet this is a safe spot in
public guilds it can be not taken over and cannot move.
** Buildings
*** Building system
Buildings start at level 0 and can be upgraded. A building at level 0 is
empty (hidden) and the player needs to creaete it.

Officers can place buildings on 'empty' locations in planets. Every
player in the guild can contribute resources to to the construction of
the building.
- Shops (notMVP) :: In shops you can buy items with the game currency and sell
  your resources.

  (during invasion) and will defend the base.

** Casino                                                           :notMVP:

store them in their cargo or add them to their ship.

*** Default
A basic starter has following modules enabled by default:
